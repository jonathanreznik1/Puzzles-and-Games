## PyGame8Queen
The n-queen chess problem is solved.  Use the interactive flags to demo how it works, and other inputs for # of boards and # of solutions.

With eight queens this puzzle has 92 distinct solutions in 12 families of solutions by symmetry operations of rotation and reflection of the board.

This package does not require any special libraries to be imported, I don't think :)
