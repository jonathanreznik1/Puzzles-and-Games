## PyGame8Queen
A board of chess squares and queen pieces with many solutions

With eight queens this puzzle has 92 distinct solutions. When counting a family of solutions by symmetry operations of rotation and reflection of the board the puzzle has just 12 solutions.

The algorithms for finding and checking solutions to N-queen problem are contained in Solutions.py and Queens.py

The game can be run in CLI Mode or in GUI mode using the Qt library.  If using the GUI it is necessary to first install the packages requirements.txt file.



# PROJECT TODO LIST: 
## 1) Queens.py
##   a. simplify the program
##   b. remove global vars if possible
##   c. cleanup the unused functions
## 2) QtGame.py
##   a. introduce gui elements
##   b. Interactive cycling through the solutions
## 3) Solutions.py
##   a. Implement Backtracking algorithm
##   b. Compare the efficiency of the two algorithms
##   c. Expand on solutions introducing concurrency
## 4) Other
##   a.  using a file to store or check solutions
##   b.  Create HINT feature with some AI or greedy algorithm
